# PythonArduinoSerialComm

A simple expirement with interfacing an Arduino to a Python script running on a PC using serial communication. 
In this example im using the arrow keys to control the rotation of a servo motor attached to pin 2 of the Arudino.

Optimizations are still needed to speed up slow string based serial communication for practical projects requiring real-time moving.
